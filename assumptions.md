# Assumptions

1. **MongoDB Atlas Configuration**: We assume that MongoDB Atlas, our database service, is set up correctly and that our application can talk to it without any issues. This means our MongoDB Atlas cluster should have the right security settings, and our application should be able to connect to it over the internet.

2. **Authentication and Authorization**: Our application doesn't have any login or permission checks for now. This means anyone who knows the URL of our API can use it. In the real world, we'd need to add a way for users to log in and check if they have permission to use our app.

3. **Data Integrity**: We trust that the URLs people send to our app are valid and safe. We don't check if they're properly formatted or if they contain any harmful code. Also, we don't make sure that the same URL isn't stored multiple times in our database.

4. **Click Tracking Privacy**: We assume that people are okay with us tracking when they click on our hashed URLs. There's no way for them to say they don't want us to track their clicks. In the future, we might need to add a way for them to opt out if they're concerned about their privacy.

5. **Single Use URLs**: Our app doesn't keep track of how many times a hashed URL is used. This means each hashed URL can be used as many times as someone wants. If we need URLs that can only be used once, we'll have to add more code to keep track of that.

6. **Security**: While we've tried to make sure our app connects to MongoDB Atlas securely and follows best practices, we're assuming that our network environment is safe. In a real-world scenario, we'd need to add more security measures like encrypting data and checking for invalid inputs to make sure our app is safe from attacks.
